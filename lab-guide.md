## Why These Tools?

Before jumping in, it's worth understanding why this lab uses Linux Mint and Kali Linux specifically — the choice isn't arbitrary.

### Linux Mint — The Server

Linux Mint is Ubuntu under the hood. It uses the same package manager (`apt`), the same systemd service management, and the same file structure as Ubuntu Server — which runs a significant portion of real production infrastructure worldwide. The reason Mint is used as the server here rather than a plain Ubuntu install comes down to practicality: it's more forgiving for beginners, ships with sensible defaults, and behaves consistently across different hardware setups.

When you're configuring `ufw`, `sudoers`, and `nginx` for the first time, the last thing you want is the OS itself getting in the way. Mint doesn't. Every command in this guide would work identically on Ubuntu 22.04 — Mint just makes the setup experience smoother.

### Kali Linux — The Client

Kali is the industry standard for security testing and penetration testing work. It ships preloaded with tools like `curl`, `nmap`, and `netcat` that security professionals use daily — nothing needs to be installed. Using Kali as the client machine does two things at once: it puts you in the mindset of someone probing a system (which is how you think about access control), and it means the tools you need are already there.

The contrast between the two machines is also deliberate. Mint represents a hardened server you're trying to protect. Kali represents an analyst's workstation — a client that should have limited, auditable access to specific resources. That's a realistic production setup.

### Why Not Windows or macOS?

Zero Trust concepts aren't OS-specific, but the tools in this lab — `ufw`, `sudoers`, `systemctl`, `auth.log` — are Linux-native. Windows has equivalent concepts (Group Policy, Event Viewer, Windows Firewall) but they work very differently. Keeping everything in one ecosystem means you're learning the security concepts without also context-switching between two completely different operating systems.

## The Big Picture

### Traditional Security (Before)

```
Internet → [Firewall] → Internal Network
                              ↓
                    Everyone inside is TRUSTED
                    Free to move anywhere
```

Once an attacker gets past the firewall, they have unrestricted access to every machine, port, and file. This is called **implicit trust** — being inside the perimeter is treated as proof that you belong there. It isn't.

### Zero Trust Architecture (After)

```
Internet → [Tailscale Identity Check] → Node A
                                           ↓
                              Must prove identity for EVERY connection
                              Access restricted by ACL rules
                              Least privilege enforced at OS level
```

Every connection requires verification. Every user gets only the access their role requires. Nothing more.

> 📖 **NIST SP 800-207 Core Principle:** *"No implicit trust is granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location."*

> 💡 In the traditional model, getting past the firewall means getting access to everything. In this lab's ZTA setup, every connection goes through Tailscale identity verification, port access is explicitly restricted, and even authenticated users have limited OS-level permissions.

## Milestone 0 — Environment Setup

### What You Need

- 2 Linux machines — this guide uses **Linux Mint** as the server and **Kali Linux** as the client
- Both machines need internet access before anything else will work

### Verify Internet Connectivity

On **Kali**, open a terminal and run:

```bash
ping google.com
```

![Kali pinging Google — internet connectivity confirmed](images/01-kali-ping-google.png)

On **Linux Mint**:

```bash
ping google.com
```

![Mint pinging Google — internet connectivity confirmed](images/02-mint-ping-google.png)

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. Zero packet loss means you're ready to proceed.

> ✅ **Checkpoint:** Both machines have internet access.

---

## Milestone 1 — Identity-Centric Connectivity

### Concept

Traditional networks identify machines by IP address. If you know the IP, you can attempt a connection — your identity is irrelevant. Zero Trust flips this: **who you are determines what you can access**, not where you happen to be on the network.

Tailscale handles this by tying each machine to your GitHub (or Google) account, assigning a stable `100.x.x.x` IP that travels with your identity, and encrypting all traffic between nodes using WireGuard.

### Step 1 — Create a Tailscale Account

Go to [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com) and sign up using your **GitHub account**. GitHub becomes your identity provider — the foundation of everything in this lab.

### Step 2 — Install Tailscale on Kali (Client)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

![Tailscale installing on Kali](images/03-tailscale-install-kali.png)

Then authenticate:

```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

You'll see a URL in the terminal:

```
To authenticate, visit:
    https://login.tailscale.com/a/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Open that URL in your browser and log in with GitHub.

### Step 3 — Install Tailscale on Linux Mint (Server)

Same two commands on Mint:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

![Tailscale installing on Linux Mint](images/04-tailscale-install-mint.png)

Authenticate with the **same GitHub account**. Both machines need to be under the same identity for the mesh to form.

### Step 4 — Verify the Connection

On either machine:

```bash
tailscale status
```

![Both machines visible in Tailscale under the same GitHub identity](images/06-tailscale-status.png)

Both machines appear with `100.x.x.x` Tailscale IPs, listed under your GitHub username. This is the shift from IP-based to identity-based networking — they're connected because of *who authenticated them*, not because of their network location.

### Step 5 — Test Connectivity

From Kali, ping the Mint server using its Tailscale IP:

```bash
ping 100.109.28.38
```

![Kali successfully pinging Mint over the Tailscale network](images/07-ping-tailscale-ip.png)

> 💡 This traffic isn't going over your local VirtualBox network. It's routed through the Tailscale mesh — authenticated, encrypted, and tied to your GitHub identity end-to-end.

> ✅ **Milestone 1 Complete:** Two machines communicating over an identity-authenticated encrypted network.

---

## Milestone 2 — Micro-segmentation

### Concept

Identity-based access gets you onto the network. But that alone isn't enough — Zero Trust also controls **what you can reach once authenticated**. Micro-segmentation means carving access into explicit, narrow zones. You're allowed to reach exactly what your role requires. Everything else is denied by default, not left open until someone blocks it.

### Step 1 — Start a Web Service on Linux Mint

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

![Python HTTP server running on port 8080 on Linux Mint](images/08-python-server-mint.png)

Leave this terminal running.

### Step 2 — Test Access from Kali Before Restrictions

```bash
curl http://100.109.28.38:8080
```

![Kali receiving the HTML directory listing from port 8080](images/09-curl-8080-kali.png)

The server's home directory is completely open. This is the problem we're about to fix.

Also note port 22 before restrictions:

```bash
curl --connect-timeout 5 http://100.109.28.38:22
```

![Port 22 connection attempt from Kali before restrictions](images/10-curl-22-blocked.png)

### Step 3 — Configure Tailscale ACL

Go to [https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls) and replace the default policy with:

```json
{
  "acls": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["YourGitHubUsername@github"],
      "dst": ["YourGitHubUsername@github:8080"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Click **Save**.

> 💡 This rule says: traffic from your GitHub identity going to port 8080 is accepted. Everything else is implicitly denied. That's the Zero Trust default-deny model written in JSON.

> ⚠️ **Real-world note:** On Tailscale's free single-user plan, all devices share the same owner identity, so the platform treats them as fully trusted at the network layer and some traffic like ICMP (ping) still passes through. In a production environment with multiple users and roles, Tailscale ACLs enforce this strictly. We compensate below with host-based firewall rules — which is actually how layered security works in practice anyway. No single control should be your only line of defense.

### Step 4 — Enforce Port Restrictions with ufw on Linux Mint

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
sudo ufw deny in on tailscale0
sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0 to any port 8080 proto tcp
sudo ufw status verbose
```

![ufw firewall rules active — only port 8080 permitted on tailscale0](images/11-ufw-rules.png)

### Step 5 — Verify from Kali

```bash
# Should return HTML
curl http://100.109.28.38:8080

# Should hang and time out
curl --connect-timeout 5 http://100.109.28.38:22
```

Port 8080 returns the directory listing. Port 22 hangs silently — that silence is the firewall working. A connection that times out with no response means the packet was dropped, not rejected. Dropping is quieter and gives an attacker less information about what's running.

> ✅ **Milestone 2 Complete:** Only port 8080 is reachable. Everything else is blocked at both the ACL layer and the host firewall layer.

---

## Milestone 3 — Principle of Least Privilege

### Concept

Even authenticated users with legitimate network access should only be able to do exactly what their role requires. A junior admin who needs to restart a web server has no business reading the system password file or creating new accounts. This isn't about distrust — it's about limiting the blast radius if that account ever gets compromised.

The Principle of Least Privilege is one of the oldest and most consistently violated security concepts in real environments. This milestone makes it testable.

### Step 1 — Install nginx on Linux Mint

```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

![nginx installed and running as a systemd service](images/12-nginx-install.png)

Unlike the Python HTTP server, nginx registers as a proper systemd service — it has a real name that `systemctl` can manage.

### Step 2 — Create the Junior Admin User

```bash
sudo adduser junioradmin
```

![junioradmin user created on Linux Mint](images/13-adduser-junioradmin.png)

Set a password when prompted. Hit Enter through the optional fields.

### Step 3 — Write the Least Privilege sudoers Rule

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Scroll to the bottom and add this line:

```
junioradmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart nginx
```

![sudoers rule added in nano — junioradmin restricted to one command](images/14-visudo.png)

Save and exit: `Ctrl+X` → `Y` → `Enter`.

What this rule actually does:
- `junioradmin` — applies to this user only
- `ALL=(ALL)` — works from any terminal session
- `NOPASSWD:` — no password prompt for this specific command
- `/bin/systemctl restart nginx` — full path, so there's no ambiguity about which binary runs

### Step 4 — Test the Policy

Switch to junioradmin:

```bash
su - junioradmin
```

**Test 1 — The one allowed action:**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

![nginx restarts silently — no output, no password prompt](images/15-nginx-restart-allowed.png)

No output. No password prompt. Silent success. That's exactly right — the command ran because it's the one thing junioradmin is permitted to do.

**Test 2 — Reading a sensitive system file:**

```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

![/etc/shadow access denied for junioradmin](images/16-shadow-blocked.png)

Blocked. `/etc/shadow` contains hashed passwords for every user on the system. If an attacker reads it, they can attempt offline cracking at their leisure. This file should never be accessible to a non-root account.

**Test 3 — Creating a new user:**

```bash
sudo adduser testuser
```

![adduser command blocked for junioradmin](images/17-adduser-blocked.png)

Blocked. Creating accounts is a root-level administrative action that has nothing to do with restarting a web service.

> ✅ **Milestone 3 Complete:** junioradmin can restart nginx and nothing else. The policy is written, tested, and working.

---

## Milestone 4 — GenAI Security Co-pilot

### Concept

Security logs tell the full story of what happened on a system — every login, every sudo command, every blocked attempt. The problem is volume and noise. A busy server generates thousands of log lines per hour, and finding the meaningful events manually takes time and experience that junior analysts are still building.

Generative AI changes this workflow. You feed raw logs to a model and get back a structured, plain-English analysis — flagged anomalies, explained violations, recommended follow-ups. This is increasingly how modern Security Operations Centers handle log triage, and building familiarity with this workflow early is genuinely useful.

### Step 1 — Extract the Auth Log

On Linux Mint, exit junioradmin first if still active:

```bash
exit
sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | tail -50
```

![auth.log showing the full session history from this lab](images/18-authlog.png)

Copy the entire output.

### Step 2 — Paste Into Claude or ChatGPT

Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) or [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) and use this prompt:

```
You are a security analyst reviewing a Linux auth.log file.

Please analyze the following log and:
1. Identify any failed authentication attempts
2. List all privilege escalation attempts (successful and blocked)
3. Flag any commands that appear suspicious or violate least privilege
4. Summarize the security posture in plain English
5. Recommend any follow-up actions

Here is the log:

[PASTE YOUR AUTH.LOG OUTPUT HERE]
```

### Step 3 — Review the Analysis

Here is what the co-pilot analysis looks like against the auth.log generated during this lab:

---

**🔍 Co-pilot Analysis**

| Time | User | Event | Severity |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 11:50:51 | obx | Created user junioradmin | ℹ️ Info |
| 11:53:36 | obx | Failed authentication — wrong password for junioradmin | ⚠️ Warning |
| 11:54:32 | junioradmin | BLOCKED — attempted to read `/etc/shadow` | 🚨 Alert |
| 11:54:44 | junioradmin | BLOCKED — attempted `adduser testuser` | 🚨 Alert |
| 11:57:43 | junioradmin | Restarted nginx — permitted by sudoers | ✅ Normal |
| 11:57:56 | junioradmin | BLOCKED — attempted `/etc/shadow` again | 🚨 Alert |

**Key findings:**

The `/etc/shadow` file was accessed twice by the same account. A single failed attempt could be accidental. A second attempt against the same sensitive file is a different pattern — in a real environment this would be flagged as potential insider threat activity or a sign the account has been compromised and someone is testing the policy boundaries.

The sudoers policy correctly blocked every unauthorized escalation attempt. The one permitted action — restarting nginx — executed cleanly.

One failed `su` authentication at 11:53:36 is low severity on its own, but worth watching for if it repeats.

**Recommended follow-up:**
- Set up `fail2ban` to alert on repeated sudo violations from the same account
- Add `auditd` for more granular command-level tracking beyond what auth.log captures
- Investigate why junioradmin attempted `/etc/shadow` access — even blocked attempts have intent behind them

## Check Your Understanding


**1.** What is the core difference between traditional perimeter security and Zero Trust?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Traditional security grants implicit trust to everything inside the network perimeter — once you're in, you're trusted. Zero Trust grants no implicit trust. Every connection must be verified regardless of where it originates. Identity, not network location, determines access.
</details>

---

**2.** In the Tailscale ACL we wrote, what happens to traffic on port 22 between the two machines?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
It is implicitly denied. Tailscale ACLs follow a default-deny model — only explicitly permitted traffic is allowed. Since only port 8080 was allowed, all other ports including SSH (22) are blocked by the policy.
</details>

---

**3.** Why did we use NOPASSWD in the sudoers rule for junioradmin?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Because junioradmin may need to restart nginx in automated or time-sensitive scenarios without interactive password entry. The security doesn't come from requiring a password — it comes from restricting the command to exactly one safe operation. Skipping the password prompt is acceptable here because the permitted action itself is harmless.
</details>

---

**4.** The /etc/shadow file was accessed twice by junioradmin. Why does a repeated attempt matter?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
A single failed attempt could be a mistake. A repeated attempt against the same sensitive file suggests deliberate intent — the user is probing for privilege escalation opportunities, or the account has been compromised and an attacker is testing the policy. Repeated violations from the same account should trigger an alert in any properly configured monitoring setup.
</details>

---

**5.** What is one real limitation of the Tailscale ACL enforcement in this lab, and how was it handled?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
On a Tailscale free single-user account, all devices share the same owner identity, so the platform treats them as fully trusted at the network layer. ICMP (ping) still passes through even with restrictive ACLs. This was handled by adding ufw rules directly on the server to enforce port-level blocking at the OS layer. Layering network ACLs with host-based firewall rules is actually best practice in production Zero Trust deployments — no single control should be the only line of defense.
</details>

## 📋 Command Reference

Every command used in this lab, explained in plain English.

### Tailscale Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh \| sh` | Downloads and runs the Tailscale installer. `curl` fetches the file, the pipe `\|` sends it straight to `sh` which executes it. |
| `sudo tailscale up` | Starts Tailscale and gives you an authentication URL. Until you visit that URL and log in, the machine isn't connected to your network. |
| `tailscale status` | Lists all machines currently connected to your Tailscale network, their IPs, and which account authenticated them. |

### Network Testing Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ping <ip>` | Sends small packets to a machine and waits for a response. Used to check if two machines can reach each other. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. |
| `curl http://<ip>:<port>` | Makes an HTTP request to a specific IP and port. If something is running there, you get a response. If not, it fails or hangs. |
| `curl --connect-timeout 5 http://<ip>:<port>` | Same as above but gives up after 5 seconds instead of waiting forever. Useful for testing blocked ports. |

### Firewall Commands (ufw)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sudo ufw enable` | Turns the firewall on. Before this, ufw is installed but not actually blocking anything. |
| `sudo ufw default deny incoming` | Sets the default rule — any incoming connection that doesn't have an explicit allow rule gets dropped silently. |
| `sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp` | Creates an exception to the default deny — port 8080 using TCP protocol is now allowed through. |
| `sudo ufw deny in on tailscale0` | Blocks all incoming traffic specifically on the Tailscale network interface (`tailscale0`). |
| `sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0 to any port 8080 proto tcp` | Adds a specific exception on the Tailscale interface — only port 8080 is permitted through. |
| `sudo ufw status verbose` | Shows all active firewall rules and the default policy. Always run this to confirm your rules applied correctly. |

### User Management Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sudo adduser junioradmin` | Creates a new Linux user account called junioradmin. Prompts you to set a password and optional details. |
| `su - junioradmin` | Switches your current terminal session to the junioradmin user. The `-` means it loads a full login environment for that user. |
| `exit` | Leaves the current user session and returns to the previous one. |

### Service Management Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sudo apt install nginx -y` | Downloads and installs the nginx web server. `apt` is Linux Mint's package manager. `-y` automatically says yes to any prompts. |
| `sudo systemctl status nginx` | Shows whether nginx is running, when it started, and its recent log output. Green "active (running)" means it's up. |
| `sudo systemctl restart nginx` | Stops nginx and starts it again. Used when you've changed a config file and need the service to reload. |
| `python3 -m http.server 8080` | Starts a simple web server on port 8080 using Python. It serves whatever files are in the current directory. No installation needed — Python ships with Linux Mint. |

### Sudo and Permissions Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sudo visudo` | Opens the sudoers file in a safe editor. Always use `visudo` instead of editing the file directly — it validates your changes before saving so you can't accidentally lock yourself out. |
| `sudo cat /etc/shadow` | Attempts to read the system password file as root. This file contains hashed passwords for every user. In this lab, junioradmin is blocked from running this. |

### Log Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sudo cat /var/log/auth.log` | Reads the authentication log — every login, sudo command, failed attempt, and session open/close is recorded here. |
| `tail -50` | When piped after another command, shows only the last 50 lines of output instead of the whole file. Useful for large log files. |
| `sudo cat /var/log/auth.log \| tail -50` | Combines both — reads the auth log and shows only the most recent 50 lines. |
